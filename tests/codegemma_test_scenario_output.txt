**Test Scenarios Using the Brute Force Technique:**

**1. Valid Solution:**
- Test if the given solution is a valid route configuration within the problem constraints.

**2. Route Length Verification:**
- Verify that the total distance traveled along each route is within the distance matrix limits.

**3. Customer Coverage:**
- Ensure that all customers are served by at least one route.

**4. Charge Station Utilization:**
- Check if the solution utilizes all available charge stations as per the problem instance.

**5. Route Optimization:**
- Test different route configurations and compare their total distances to identify the most efficient solution.

**6. Solution Uniqueness:**
- Ensure that the generated solution is unique and does not duplicate routes or customers.

**7. Exception Handling:**
- Test for potential exceptions that may occur during the solution generation process.

**8. Performance Optimization:**
- Measure the execution time and complexity of the solution generation algorithm to identify areas for improvement.

**9. Input Validation:**
- Validate the input data structures and constraints to ensure they comply with the problem specifications.

**10. Coverage of All Customers:**
- Ensure that all customers are visited exactly once in the solution.

**Additional Considerations:**

- The test scenarios can be extended to include additional constraints or objectives from the problem domain.
- The brute force technique can be combined with other testing techniques to enhance the coverage and validity of the test suite.
- The specific test scenarios may vary depending on the particular problem instance and constraints.
