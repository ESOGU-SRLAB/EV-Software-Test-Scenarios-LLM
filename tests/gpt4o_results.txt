The test scenarios are providing a comprehensive cover from verifying route configuration, inputData validation, solution optimization, and performance optimization. It also includes potential exception handling. I will say that the test scenarios have done an excellent job covering various metrics that need checking for a TSP solution. 
The maximum number of test scenarios isn't specified. However, the variety and comprehensiveness of the provided scenarios seem to cover all major considerations when working with the traveling salesman problem and brute force solutions.

It's important that all terminologies used are suitable for the context of the problem and the algorithm utilised. Here all terminologies properly correspond to the traveling salesman problem, the constraints at hand, and the brute force algorithm. Every scenario is linguistically correct and is compatible with the source code.

Besides these, few more scenarios related to the evaluation of results like monitoring memory usage, execution speed, behavior with large random data, etc. might have added more value to the evaluations.

Overall, considering the language correctness and compatibility with the source code, I would give this a score of 91%.
